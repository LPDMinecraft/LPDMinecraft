### My history

That's me! Lukas(born 5.9.2008) and I'm already programming. How it came about:
I wished for the game Minecraft for my 6th birthday. I got the game because it was very active on Youtube at that time and I only stayed there because my parents had Youtube on the TV. So when I was only 7 years old, I started programming in batch and Java. I started programming HTML and CSS when I was 9. At the age of 11 I started programming JS, Phyton and Lua. But I don't really deal with the last three programming languages.
